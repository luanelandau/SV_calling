# SV_calling
This is a repository of multiple SV callers that I have tested for my assemblies and that show different results. Once again, these scripts are optimized for use on CCR cluster (from the University at Buffalo), and are not validated yet. I am still learning the process and this are all on-going work. As a note, I have had better results with SV-ASM than with SNIFFLES, but both are widely used.
